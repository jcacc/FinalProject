Just a simple ATM app that I created for the Code KY Final Project. 

It fulfills the following project requirements:

1. Master loop
2. Uses a list
3. Has more than one class



## Master loop
- This is used at the Main Menu screen, where you pick the transaction type.

## Uses a list
- A list is utilized to store user account numbers, personal identification numbers, account balanace, and card numbers.

## More than one class
- Several classes are utilized for the difference transaction types, user account information, a utility class, and a validator class to check data.
